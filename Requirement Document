This is a python based project. The main objective of this project is to read emails
in an inbox and judge if any reply is required or not. The program should continuously
listen to the inbox. Whenever a new email comes , it should read the email and analyse to
find out if it requires any reply or any other action. It should be able to tell if
an email is a promotional email , an alert or a notification or something that requires a reply.
The output for now will be displayed on the terminal itself.
I need to find out a platform or any other mechanism by which we can view the results.
Probably a push notification.
